"proxy_pass" directive is duplicate 

Solved, used the following command:

   sudo grep -ri 'proxy_pass' /etc/nginx/
    //Found the duplicate and deleted it.


1️⃣ sudo

Runs the command as root (superuser).
Needed because many files inside /etc/nginx/ are not readable by normal users.

2️⃣ grep

Stands for Global Regular Expression Print.
Used to search for text inside files.

3️⃣ -r

Recursive search.
Tells grep to search all files inside /etc/nginx/ and its subdirectories.

This includes:
nginx.conf
sites-available/
sites-enabled/

any included .conf files

4️⃣ -i

Case-insensitive search.

Matches:

proxy_pass
Proxy_Pass
PROXY_PASS

Useful when you’re not sure about casing.

5️⃣ 'proxy_pass'

The search pattern.
proxy_pass is an Nginx directive used for reverse proxying (common in Node.js, APIs, upstream servers).

6️⃣ /etc/nginx/

The directory to search in.

This is where all Nginx configuration files live.

🔍 What this command does (in plain English)

“Search through all Nginx config files, ignoring case, and show me every place where proxy_pass is used, even inside nested folders.”

🧠 Typical output example
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default:    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
/etc/nginx/conf.d/api.conf:           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4000;


Each line shows:

file_path : matching_line

🔥 Handy upgrades (optional)

If you want line numbers:

sudo grep -rin 'proxy_pass' /etc/nginx/
