"Remember that there is no code faster than no code."

today readed this shit. and that making sense. last we till now i coded lot of shit. 
like dish size mesaurment program in py to mogodb merging shit. to creating filter.
and past i this lot of time. creating login. creating auth/enscptin by own self(approx 1 month  wasted),
