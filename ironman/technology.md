parten:-

1st posses the ans and thruth. will not lead 
                 
                 "If I believe that I already know the answer and possess the truth, then I'm not genuinely open to learning larger truths."

2nd kill all demon process

        noises. of family. socitey. social media. hold of anger surpress our own inner voice.
        and any things that run in background.
        
        noises killers: going to nature. focus on breath. till you get your voice. 
        (+swimming and meaningful talk with good listener)
        
        i really agree with pauls remark of killing the demons.
        because listing to your own inner voice, taking fast decision and taking full responsiblity of it.
        is the way.
        
        (fast decision and  full responsiblity words are of sam manik swa -- and without any doubt. agree with it )
         and its oky to be weried and different. not following  (social shit).

         and contry like India(Developing nations).  much/strong noices. culturlarl,natinal,regional...
         
         but much noises. strong focus on breath.
         
         {it same like every anger is operchunity to over come it.
         and strong noices.   strong focus
        (if you are will to focus)
