death. 
is only word always with me.
  from childhood. i atempted to quit to not goping to school(because never get validate there always get beten by teachers). 
  even when i was in 6 th class. after school there is a spot where shcool bus take turn to move to direction to home.
  where in a shop board written a qoute "i hate my life. i am bad boy". and that time that qoute remind of one thing "Sucide".

  after completing school. went to Kushinagar to learn meditate. (Where bhuda Die).
  and eventually failed to Understand the essense of Mediate 

  now today. had a observation. people who do sucide are the precher of not doing it.
  
  Susant Singh Rajput - in movie chichore - where his son try to attemp to quit. (give a good example of not quitting)
  Robin McLaurin Williams - in movie deid poets socity- where his student did sucide and that movie give really not quiting. you can lie persue what ever your uinique vision seeking
  Chester Charles Bennington - his band made really good song on not quiting - One more light- on one of there freinds quiting (song is like you matter kind)
