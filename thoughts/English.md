today when i was reading. i start reading loud in my head the words & phases
that i dont know and highligthing the words that i did't know the pronunciation adn meaning.
that same time. in head came one story of Richard fryedmen. when he was young guy. one aother dude ask him. 
you know what we call that bird in spanish[1]. then he mention the birds name in spanish and told Richard "you father not teach you that".
surprisingly. his father teach him. something better. his father told him. we call that bird in spanish this, in janpanes this, in chines this....so on.
but thats not matter what we call that bird because in different part of people calling diffenet name. so Richard it does not matter what we call that bird.
it matter what that does.

that story. also remminds me another teaching of his father. about collars. his father taught him these people run for collars and
hide insurity behind collars that they did not make something useful for people {or people's}.
his father teaching reminds the Paul buchheit advice of "Stay aware, where you getting the validation".
and Ashneer Grover saying "India leave the english stupidity and start working on 
there language hindi ( view for hindi, speaker )"


yestarday. we both discussing "importance of Language" specificaly english
