read the error.
then google. and doc (with different source)
go through code line by line, reading it and explaining it out loud as you go.

Narrow Down Your Problem and Understand Where the Error is Generated
  
  take break.think of something

look for help 
                    Try to be as detailed as possible. try to explain what are you working on, what are you trying to achieve and what is the problem you're facing.
                    
                    Show the exact error.
                    
                    Show the related code you think is causing the error.
                    
                    Mention what solutions you've tried so far and why they didn't work.
                    
                    Investigate and show that you've done research about the problem. Even though asking for help is totally ok, I think you have to first evacuate the more obvious and easy paths before asking someone else to do the thinking for you. That means that you've analyzed your code, googled the problem, read other solutions and official documentation, tried many approaches and none of them worked. Only then is it acceptable to ask someone else for help. I think this is a matter of being able to independently learn and solve problems, and also respect other people's time.
